The MET website is created based on stylish design, using HTML and the SCSS preprocessor, taking into account various screen resolutions. Thanks to the use of Grid and Flex design, this website looks good on any device.

The website includes interactive elements such as icons, buttons, links, and images that enlarge, underline, change color, or shape when interacted with. This adds liveliness to the page and makes the user's experience more engaging.

Additionally, internal navigation with Smooth scrolling has been implemented to provide seamless transitions between sections, making the interaction with the site even more enjoyable for users.
